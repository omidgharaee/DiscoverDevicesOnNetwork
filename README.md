Discover Devices on a Network with MAC Addresses

This C# console application allows you to discover devices on your local network along with their MAC addresses.
It sends ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets to each IP address in a specified range and retrieves the MAC addresses of active devices using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
